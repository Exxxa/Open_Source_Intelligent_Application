# Project Plan: "Pepe Silvia" - Interactive Investigation Board

## Project Vision

"Pepe Silvia" is an intelligent investigation board application that helps users visualize and discover connections between different pieces of information, similar to the classic detective's string board but with modern data analysis capabilities. The application will allow users to dynamically build and explore relationship networks from multiple data sources, creating an engaging and intuitive way to analyze complex information sets.

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Investigation Board

- Digital cork board interface with draggable elements
- String/connection visualization between related elements
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Multiple board support for different investigations
- Auto-layout algorithms for clear visualization

### 2. Data Integration Hubs

- News API integration for real-time news data
- Social media data collection (Twitter/X API)
- Wikipedia API for background information
- Financial data API (e.g., Alpha Vantage)

### 3. Analysis Features

- Automated relationship discovery
- Temporal analysis (timeline visualization)
- Entity extraction and categorization
- Sentiment analysis of text data
- Pattern recognition in connected data

### 4. User Interface Elements

- Search and filter toolbar
- Dynamic node creation and editing
- Connection strength visualization
- Color coding for different types of data
- Note-taking and annotation capabilities
