## 2. Risk Mitigation Strategies:
- Delays in API Integration
  - Select APIs with strong documentation and community support.
  - Have fallback APIs for data sources.
- Team Member Unavailability
  - Have overlapping roles to ensure redundancy.
  - Document progress and share resources for smooth transitions.
  - Clearly communicate your schedule and availability
- Scope Creep
  - Have a clear project scope and objectives at the outset.
- Data Security and Privacy Concerns
  - Ensure compliance with data protection laws.
  - Use secure coding practices and data encryption where necessary.
- Technical Challenges with GUI Development
  - Allocate sufficient time for GUI development and iterative testing.
  - Conduct user testing to gather feedback on usability.
- Insufficient Testing
  - Follow a comprehensive testing schedule including unit, integration, and system tests.
- Version Control Conflicts
  - Use branching and merging strategies.
